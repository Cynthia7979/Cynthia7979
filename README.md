I'm an international CS student graduating this December and actively seeking entry-level roles in **cybersecurity, IT, security engineering, or backend development**. If you're looking for someone who tackles complex systems with systematic problem-solving and clear communication, let's connect at [ywang2210@hotmail.com](mailto:ywang2210+GitHub@hotmail.com).

🔍 I specialize in navigating complexity, whether that's reverse-engineering undocumented codebases, building hardware simulations for medical device security research, or orchestrating multi-component systems with Docker and microservices. I'm drawn to work that requires digging deep into how systems operate, finding what breaks, and understanding why.

💬 Self-directed learning is my default mode. I maintain an Obsidian knowledge vault to structure and synthesize insights across domains, treat unfamiliar territory as an opportunity rather than an obstacle, and believe that clear documentation and maintainable code are the foundation of strong collaboration.

✍️ I write code well-organized and thoroughly commented code that's designed so anyone (including future me) can understand the what, why, and how at first glance. Clean code and clear documentation are how we turn solo projects into sustainable team efforts.
